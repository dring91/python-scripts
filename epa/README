Main Driver - Analyze.py

The aim of this program is to operate on simple, modest sets of numbers that can be read in "stream-like" fashion. It will hopefully replace or supplement some of the operations lacking in gnuplot (e.g. - quickly finding a mean). The main program should be robust and completely separate from the "plug-ins". The plug-ins should be short and need not be heavily optimized. 

For example:

def mean(data):
  for i in data:
    mu += line
    N += 1
  return mu / N

A list of plug-ins implemented so far:
 - sum (with weighting, it can be used to take a mean or any linear combination)
 - product (with weighting, it can take a geometric mean)
 - first (first element of list or row)
 - last (last element of a list or row)
 - head (all elements except last, i.e. complement of last)
 - tail (all elements except first, i.e. complement of first)

 -- analyze file plug-in output --

  read file data as a chunk
  analyze data using plug-in
  write to file or stdout

--- Extension ideas ---
--  - write a plug-in class
